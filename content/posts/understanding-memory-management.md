Memory management is the cornerstone of systems programming. Understanding how memory allocation works at the kernel level is crucial for writing efficient and safe code.

## The Memory Hierarchy

The modern memory hierarchy consists of several levels:

    CPU Registers <-> L1 Cache <-> L2 Cache <-> L3 Cache
           |                                       |
    Main Memory (RAM) <-> Storage (SSD/HDD)

## Stack vs Heap

The stack and heap are two fundamental memory regions with different characteristics:

### Stack Memory
- Fast allocation/deallocation
- Limited size (typically 8MB on Linux)
- Automatic memory management
- LIFO (Last In, First Out) order

### Heap Memory
- Flexible allocation size
- Manual management required
- Potential for fragmentation
- Slower than stack allocation

## Memory Allocation in C

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

// Stack allocation - automatic cleanup
void stack_example() {
    int stack_array[100];
    char buffer[256];
    
    // Fast allocation, automatic cleanup
    memset(buffer, 0, sizeof(buffer));
    printf("Stack allocation: %p\n", buffer);
}

// Heap allocation - manual management
void heap_example() {
    // Dynamic allocation
    int *heap_array = malloc(100 * sizeof(int));
    if (heap_array == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
        return;
    }
    
    // Initialize memory
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        heap_array[i] = i * i;
    }
    
    // Critical: always free allocated memory
    free(heap_array);
    heap_array = NULL; // Avoid dangling pointer
}
```

## Key Takeaways

1. Always understand your memory access patterns
2. Minimize dynamic allocation in performance-critical code
3. Use tools like Valgrind to detect memory leaks
4. Consider memory alignment for optimal performance

Memory management is an art that requires both theoretical knowledge and practical experience. Master it, and you'll write better systems code.
